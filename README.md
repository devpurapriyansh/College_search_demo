# Project-1
This is the very first web page that I coded. For making this I took the referencce of a YouTube video of Traversy Media. I edited the website according to my taste and thinking. 

This is the website that I have made using HTML and simple CSS. In this I have not used the flexbox technique of CSS. The entire code is written in HTML and CSS and the web page is made completely responsive using media queries. I have also used some copyright free images form Pixabay.com and Unsplash.com

I have made a simple prototype webite for searching colleges and different exams. It took me 2 days (7 - 10 hrs.) to create the entire project. It was fun coding and I also got to learn so much from this project.

To check the webpage either visit https://devpurapriyansh.github.io/College_search_demo/ or clone in your local machine.
